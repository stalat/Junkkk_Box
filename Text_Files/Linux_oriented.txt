To find a string inside every file in a folder use:
	grep -irsl "string_to_be_searched" *

If I want to find the location of a file whose(file) is completely known to me, Then I can use:
	locate "filename"

To check whether your system is 32 bit or 64 bit, check with:
	
	uname -a 

If your system is 32-bit; then it'll show as:
	i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

If your system is 64-bit; then it'll show as:
	x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

To Install a repo. into your system, How I can do that:???

	Suppose, I need to install terminator terminal on my system then I will have to have a need of RPMForge Repository; to get this repo.

		sudo wget http://packages.sw.be/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.i686.rpm
		sudo rpm -Uvh rpmforge-release-0.5.2-2.el6.rf.i686.rpm
	By these commands Repo. has been installed. They will be installed in ./etc/...
		then install any package:
		sudo yum install terminator

To check which process is under root and which is in under normal user:
	
	ls -lart

To change the ownership of the folder named Friends to stalat use :
	
	sudo chown -R stalat:stalat ./Friends	<Changing the ownership>[-R is used to change the ownership of folders inside folders]
	sudo chmod -R ugo ./Friends		<Giving the permission>


If I want to check the code of python pre-defined methods, Then they can be look over into:
		/usr/lib/python2.6 ... and their code can be seen as : z+M, z+R, z+O

In python seq 10 will generate the sequence from 1 to 10, seq 10 20 will generate the sequence from 10-20

cat q.txt w.txt will append the item as vertically, first q's and then w's

If I want to append the items horizontally, Then I'll have to use paste command as:
		paste q.txt w.txt

If I want to merge the commands in a single statement then I can use it by using back tick(`) as:
		echo `paste q.txt w.txt` 

If I want to make the sequence as in matrix form, then I can use it as:
		seq 0 9 | xargs -n 5(number of columns)

If I want to locate the location of a file, the it can be done as:
		locate "filename"

If I want to have a string splitted by specified character then It can be used by awk commands as:
		grep "*\.mp3" | awk -F'="' '{print $NF}' | awk -F'">' '{print $1}' | wc -l
			[-F'="' will split having ="] 
			[$NF the last column of the string]
			[$1 $2 the column no.1 no.2 after splitting]
			[wc -l number of records]

grep -v ".mp3"  [it will display all the things except .mp3]
grep -v "\.mp3"	[it will take the .(dot) as the part of the searched string]
ifconfig
internetip
ps aux
ps aux|grep "string"
F6 [To go to URL bar directly]
.source/bin/activate [To activate the things]
find . -name "filename" [will find from the current folder]
Ctrl+Alt+L [to lock the screen]
Ctrl+Shift+T [to open a new tab in terminal]
Alt+f2	[Run application]
Ctrl+Shift+N	[New gnome Terminal]
Ctrl+Shift+W	[Close a tab in gnome terminal]
Ctrl+Page_Up/Page_Down	[Switch over tabs in gnome terminal]

TMUX:
		ctrl+z
		ctrl+z+% [To open a tab vertically]
		ctrl+z+" [To opena a tab horizontally]
		tabnew "file_name" [To open another tab in single Terminal screen]
		:shell [To open shell without closing the vim]
		ctrl+e [To move downwards the vim editor screen]
		<+m,n [To move back and forth in the terminal]
		ctrl+z+release+<uparrwow,downarrow,rightarrow,leftarrow> [To make movement in terminal screens]

VirtualEnv:
	
	VirtualEnv is used to install packages and use them without interrupting the system python packages.
	The commands to install the VirtualEnv without sudo passwords are:
		
	    $ mkdir ~/bin
	    $ mkdir -p ~/lib/python2.6
	    $ mkdir -p ~/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
	    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py
	    $ python virtual-python.py --no-site-packages
	    $ wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
	    $ ~/bin/python ez_setup.py 
	    ~/bin/python ez_setup.py -U setuptools
	    /home/admin/bin/easy_install virtualenv
	    /home/admin/bin/virtualenv . --no-site-packages
	    ./source/bin/activate

Pip:
	
	Pip is compatible with Python2.6 and can be used to install the packages that are not in our system
		
		pip install "package _name"


If I want to login into another system then use:
		
		ssh username@ip_adress
		password:____________


ShellScript:

		If the shell script name is "dm_identification_custom.sh",
	Then we can make it executable by executing this command:
		
		chmod +x dm_identification_custom.sh
	
	and after making this shell script as executable:
		./dm_identification_custom.sh 


If you want to print only one line from the file; then use:

	cat DEPENDENCIES.TXT | grep -i "\.db" > xyz.txt

some more git commands that are used in speficied Cases:
		git branch --set-upstream "branch_name" [The header will move to Branch "branch_name"]
		git branch -D "branch_name" [It will delete the Branch "branch_name"]

If you want to log a repository from the another directory then you can use:

		git --git-dir=/repo/path/.git log -3 --pretty=oneline

If you want to list the number of items in a particular directory; then use: 

		#print len([name for name in os.listdir(t)])		#where t=location of the folder you want to lookup.
		#print os.listdir(t)

If you want to move to a particular directory via python code; then use:

		#os.chdir("/stalat/Hello/Talat/Parwez/Hi")

I want to open a pdf file by linux-terminal, use:
		gnome-terminal "filename.pdf"


I want to check the number of lines/words/character/bytes in a file; then use:
		wc -<option>

With Single-user-mode, remote logins are disabled, networking is disabled, and most daemons are not started used for system maintenance only; 
To make the system run on single-user-mode; Add 1 or single @last as:
		kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.27.21-170.2.56.fc10.i686 ro root=/dev/hda5 rhgb quiet 1
		kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.27.21-170.2.56.fc10.i686 ro root=/dev/hda5 rhgb quiet single

Services in Linux can be started or stopped by going to /etc/init.d and stop/start after their name as:
		/etc/init.d/httpd stop
		/etc/init.d/httpd start
		/etc/init.d/httpd restart
		/etc/init.d/httpd reload

 To check the previous and current runlevel of system use:
		#runlevel 			--> N 5 (N = Previous runlevel and 5 = Current runlevel)

If I want to shut down the system, Then time limit and options can also be used, The possible solutions are:- -f, -h, -k, -r, -F
		shutdown <option> <time>



				LINUX INSTALLATION AND PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

The LILO is a small utility designed to load the Linux kernel into memory and start it.
The LILO prompt is designed to allow to select from multiple kernels or OS installed on your system.
GRUB also do the same work as BOOT LOADER

RPM(Red Hat Package Manager):
			     Most popular methods for the distribution of software for Linux and is installed by default on most distributions.
					rpm -i <package_name> 				#To install new packages.
					rpm -U <package_name>				#Upgrade the Installed package.	  
					rpm -e <package_name>   			#Uninstall the package
			     Before uninstall the package, I need to check the dependencies to other modules; So better to remove them by 
					rpm --nodeps


YUM(Yellowdog Updater Modified): Installing updating and removing packages. --> /etc/yum.conf
					yum install <package_name>			#Install a package on system
					yum erase <package_name>			#Remove a package from system
					yum update <package_name>			#Update a package on system
					yum list <package_name>				#list a group of packages on system
					yum search <package_name>			#search package details for the given string
					yum info <package_name> 			#Will give you all the information about the installed package.


UNIX AND LINUX COMMANDS:
			It's the job of shell to provide the cmd and to interpret the commands.
			Bash(Bourne Again Shell) is a GNU version of shell


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
---------------------------------------------------------------COMMANDS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

echo 			echo PS1					#to print the content
PATH			echo $PATH					#The less program is located in the directory /usr/bin. Placing /usr/bin in your PATH 										enables you to execute less by simply typing less rather than the explicit /usr/bin/less.
export			export "shell_variable"				#Make a shell variable as Environment variable


For the bash to excute the command, The command must be in any of the following:
	A bash built-in command that is a part of bash itself
	An executable program located in the path variable
	An executable program whose filename I specified explicitely

If I declare a variable my_var="Hello"--> echo $my_var, It will show "Hello", But If'll go to new bash by typing bash and do there as echo $my_var, then it won't show any 
output because I'm in new shell and my_var was declared in the old shell , So to make my_var to be availabled to each shell, I'll have a need to make the my_var as enviro-
-nment variable So It can be used in other shell also, 

set -o			$set -o 					#Will marks the variable that are modified or created.

ls -l *.txt		$ls -l *.txt					#Will give all the files ending with ".txt" <* --can be anything>


Occassionally I may need to run the command that is not in my path and not built in shell. Then It'll be best If I can add the direcotry to my path that contains the specific commands.

For Loop:
			var1=1,var2=2,var3=3
			for var in $var1,$var2,$var3
			do	
			echo $var
			done
Executing more than one command in a single line by command separator ';':
			ls;ps

History of Commands:
			command history
			echo $HISTSIZE					#How much history you'll see 

!!									#bang-bang, refers to the most recent command
!n									#Refers to the nth command from the history 
!string									#refers to the recent command started with the string
^string1^string2							#refers to the last command and change the string1 with string2

yolk-l is used to check what all the things with what versions are installed.
